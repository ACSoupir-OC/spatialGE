## Arguments

-   x:

    an STlist

-   spot_minreads:

    the minimum number of total reads for a spot to be retained

-   spot_maxreads:

    the maximum number of total reads for a spot to be retained

-   spot_mingenes:

    the minimum number of non-zero counts for a spot to be retained

-   spot_maxgenes:

    the maximum number of non-zero counts for a spot to be retained

-   spot_minpct:

    the minimum percentage of counts for features defined by
    `spot_pct_expr` for a spot to be retained.

-   spot_maxpct:

    the maximum percentage of counts for features defined by
    `spot_pct_expr` for a spot to be retained.

-   gene_minreads:

    the minimum number of total reads for a gene to be retained

-   gene_maxreads:

    the maximum number of total reads for a gene to be retained

-   gene_minspots:

    he minimum number of spots with non-zero counts for a gene to be
    retained

-   gene_maxspots:

    the maximum number of spots with non-zero counts for a gene to be
    retained

-   gene_minpct:

    the minimum percentage of spots with non-zero counts for a gene to
    be retained

-   gene_maxpct:

    the maximum percentage of spots with non-zero counts for a gene to
    be retained

-   samples:

    samples (as in `names(x@counts)`) to perform filtering.

-   rm_tissue:

    sample (as in `names(x@counts)`) to remove from STlist. Removes
    samples in `x@counts`, `x@tr_counts`, `x@spatial_meta`,
    `x@gene_meta`, and `x@sample_meta`

-   rm_spots:

    vector of spot/cell IDs to remove. Removes spots/cells in
    `x@counts`, `x@tr_counts`, and `x@spatial_meta`

-   rm_genes:

    vector of gene names to remove from STlist. Removes genes in
    `x@counts`, `x@tr_counts`, and `x@gene_meta`

-   rm_genes_expr:

    a regular expression that matches genes to remove. Removes genes in
    `x@counts`, `x@tr_counts`, and `x@gene_meta`

-   spot_pct_expr:

    a expression to use with `spot_minpct` and `spot_maxpct`. By default
    '^MT-'.

## Value

an STlist containing the filtered data

</div>

<div class="section level2">

## Details

This function provides options to filter elements in an STlist. It can
remove cells/spots or genes based on raw counts (`x@counts`). Users can
input an regular expression to query gene names and calculate
percentages (for example % mtDNA genes). The function also can filter
entire samples. Note that the function removes cells/spots, genes,
and/or samples in the raw counts, transformed counts, spatial variables,
gene variables, and sample metadata. Also note that the function filters
in the following order:

1.  Samples (`rm_tissue`)

2.  Spots (`rm_spots`)

3.  Genes (`rm_genes`)

4.  Genes matching `rm_genes_expr`

5.  Min and max counts
