## Arguments

-   x:

    an STlist with transformed gene expression

-   samples:

    the samples on which the test should be executed

-   topgenes:

    the number of high-variance genes to be tested. These genes are
    selected in descending order of variance as caclulated using
    Seurat's vst method

-   annot:

    the name of a column in `@spatial_meta` containing the tissue domain
    assignments for each spot or cell. These assignments can be
    generated using the `STclust` function

-   ref:

    one of the tissue domains in the column specified in `annot`,
    corresponding to the "reference" cluster or domain. Spearman's
    correlations will be calculated using spots assigned to domains
    other than this reference domain (or domains specified in
    `exclude`).

-   exclude:

    optional, a cluster/domain to exclude from the analysis

-   out_rm:

    logical (optional), remove gene expression outliers defined by the
    interquartile method. This option is only valid when `robust=F`

-   limit:

    limite the analysis to spots/cells with distances to `ref` shorther
    than the value specified here. Useful when gradients might occur at
    smaller scales or when the domain in `ref` is scattered through the
    tissue. Caution must be used due to difficult interpretation of
    imposed limits. It is suggested to run analysis without restricted
    distances in addition for comparison.

-   distsumm:

    the distance summary metric to use in correlations. One of `min` or
    `avg`

-   min_nb:

    the minimum number of immediate neighbors a spot or cell has to have
    in order to be included in the analysis. This parameter seeks to
    reduce the effect of isolated `ref` spots on the correlation

-   robust:

    logical, whether to use robust regression (`MASS` and `sfsmisc`
    packages)

-   nb_dist_thr:

    a numeric vector of length two indicating the tolerance interval to
    assign spots/cells to neighborhoods. The wider the range of the
    interval, the more likely distinct neighbors to be considered. If
    NULL, `c(0.75, 1.25)` and `c(0.25, 3)` is assigned for Visium and
    CosMx respectively.

-   log_dist:

    logical, whether to apply the natural logarithm to the spot/cell
    distances. It applies to all distances a constant (1e-200) to avoid
    log(0)

-   cores:

    the number of cores used during parallelization. If NULL (default),
    the number of cores is defined automatically

-   verbose:

    logical, whether to print text to console

## Details

**This is the legacy implementation from version 1.x.** Use `STgradient`
for new projects.

The `STgradient` function fits linear models and calculates Spearman
coefficients between the expression of a gene and the minimum or average
distance of spots or cells to a reference tissue domain. In other wordsm
the `STgradient` function can be used to investigate if a gene is
expressed higher in spots/cells closer to a specific reference tissue
domain, compared to spots/cells farther from the reference domain (or
viceversa as indicated by the Spearman's cofficient).
